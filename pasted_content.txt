Highlights
	1.	Strong Traction + Momentum
	•	$500K ARR to date, with a robust pipeline forecasted to reach $3M ARR by year-end.
	•	Already two acquisition offers—including a hard offer at $30M from an existing partner.
	2.	Strategic Corporate Interest
	•	Cisco Systems: The Head of Webex and Collaboration has introduced SimpleAI to Cisco’s Corp Dev as “the best multi-agent automation solution.” This corporate validation underscores potential for strategic M&A or deeper partnership.
	3.	Fundraise + Valuation
	•	Raising $1.5M at a $15M post-money cap—an attractive entry point relative to the company’s traction and inbound acquisition interest.
	•	Only $450k raised to date, so minimal dilution/overhang.
	4.	Early-Stage Risk, High Upside
	•	SimpleAI has checked our early-stage boxes— strong product-market fit, rapid growth potential, enterprise partnerships, and proven ability to execute.
	•	The market for AI-driven automation continues to expand, offering significant scalability over the next 12–24 months.
	•	A dual M&A/raise effort is planned for end of year; if a strong acquisition offer emerges, LPs could see near-term liquidity.
	5.	Why Now?
	•	Multi-agent AI is a high-growth category as enterprises look to securely deploy advanced AI workflows at scale.
	•	SimpleAI’s “white-glove” approach to enterprise security and compliance sets it apart from open-source or purely horizontal automation competitors.
	•	This is a pivotal moment to invest at a modest valuation with credible near-term exit opportunities.
